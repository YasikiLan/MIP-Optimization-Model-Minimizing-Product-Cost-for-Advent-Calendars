# Chanel Advent Calendar Redesign

**Overview**

This repository is dedicated to the redesign and development of Chanel's Advent Calendar, incorporating customer feedback to enhance satisfaction while optimizing production costs.

**Background**

Our previous advent calendar received significant negative feedback, highlighting the need for a more customer-focused approach. As we prepare to launch a new version, our primary goals are:
Customer Satisfaction: Actively addressing past concerns and improving the product experience.
Cost Optimization: Striking a balance between quality and affordability to ensure the calendar remains a desirable and accessible product.

**Objective**

Scenario 1: Individual Calendar Cost Minimization
The first objective is to identify the lowest possible cost for producing a single advent calendar, assuming unlimited products available.
Scenario 2: Bulk Production Cost Minimization
The second objective is to determine the minimum cost per calendar when producing 100 units, considering real-world inventory constraints of 70 units per product.

**Constraints**
1. Box Allocation Requirements

  Each of the 31 boxes in the advent calendar must be assigned exactly one product.

3. Product Category Distribution Rules

  Maximum of 3 identical products from large categories (Eyes, Lips, Fragrance)

  No product duplication allowed within small categories

4. Niche Product Marketing Strategy

  To introduce customers to new and unique products:
  Minimum: 1 niche product per calendar
  Maximum: 3 niche products per calendar

6. Inventory Management Constraints (This Constraint Only Apply for Scenario 2)

  Each product type has a fixed inventory of 70 units.
  Target allocation volume: 100 advent calendars.
